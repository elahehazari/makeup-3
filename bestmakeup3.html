            Cosmetics are care substances used to enhance the appearance or odor of the human body. They are generally
            mixtures of
            chemical compounds, some being derived from natural sources, many being synthetic.

            The word cosmetics derives from the Greek κοσμητική τέχνη (kosmetikē tekhnē), meaning "technique of dress
            and ornament",
            from κοσμητικός (kosmētikos), "skilled in ordering or arranging" and that from κόσμος (kosmos), meaning
            amongst others
            "order" and "ornament".

            Archaeological evidence of cosmetics dates at least from ancient Egypt and Greece. According to one source,
            early major
            developments include:

            Castor oil used by ancient Egypt as a protective balm.
            Skin creams made of beeswax,
            olive oil, and rosewater, described by Romans.
            Vaseline and lanolin in the nineteenth century.
            Nivea Creme in 1911

            The Ancient Greeks also used cosmetics. Cosmetics are mentioned in the Old Testament, such as in 2 Kings
            9:30, where
            Jezebel painted her eyelids—approximately 840 BC—and in the book of Esther, where various beauty treatments
            are
            described.

            Cosmetic use was frowned upon at many points in Western history. For example, in the 19th century, Queen
            Victoria
            publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar, and acceptable only for use by actors

            Of the major cosmetics firms, the largest is L'Oréal, which was founded by Eugene Schueller in 1909 as the
            French
            Harmless Hair Colouring Company (now owned by Liliane Bettencourt 26% and Nestlé 28%; the remaining 46% is
            traded
            publicly). The market was developed in the USA during the 1910s by Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, and
            Max Factor.
            These firms were joined by Revlon just before World War II and Estée Lauder just after.

            Beauty products are now widely available from dedicated internet-only retailers, who have more recently been
            joined
            online by established outlets, including the major department stores and traditional bricks and mortar
            beauty retailers.

            Although modern make-up has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of males are
            gradually using
            cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features. Concealer is commonly
            used by
            cosmetic-conscious men. Cosmetics brands release cosmetic products especially tailored for men, and men are
            increasingly
            using such products.</p>
